                            <h3>Base Camp Coding Academy</h3>
                            <p>Named to Southern Living‚Äôs Southerners of the Year 2017 while leading Base Camp Coding
                                Academy, I am passionate about creating transformative opportunities for young people in
                                rural communities. My impact at Base Camp has granted over 30 recent high school
                                graduates the training to forego traditional four-year degree paths and enter employment
                                earning double the local median income. Base Camp launched in 2016 as a three-year pilot
                                and I was recruited as the organization‚Äôs first employee, charged with guiding the
                                program from concept to implementation. The program‚Äôs success through the pilot sparked
                                a new initiative, and now Base Camp serves as the cornerstone of Everest: Mississippi‚Äôs
                                First Rural Education and Innovation Hub. Base Camp is the unifying enterprise in a
                                consortium of regional workforce development agencies and regional tech-giants like
                                FedEx, CSpire, and CoreLogic working to make Everest possible.<br>
